# Data-Manipulation-Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global health expenditure and life expectancy data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It collects, cleans, and aggregates data from multiple sources to uncover insights about the relationship between healthcare spending and life expectancy across countries and years.

## Datasets
- **Downloaded Dataset:** [WHO Global Health Expenditure Database](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en)
- **Web Collection #1:** [Wikipedia - List of countries by total health expenditure per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita)
- **Web Collection #2:** [Life Expectancy Table (JSON)](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/data/asset/data/life-expectancy-table.json)

## Features
- Data collection and cleaning functions for each dataset
- Handling of inconsistencies and missing values
- Generation of at least 5 insights and 3 data visualizations
- Export of aggregated data to summary files
- All code and analysis in Jupyter Notebooks (`Data Manipulation.ipynb`, `Data Visualization.ipynb`)

## Usage
1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to collect, clean, and analyze the data.
3. Visualizations and summary files will be generated as output.
4. Review the explanations and cited sources for further details.
